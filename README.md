Titan
=========

Titan is a responsive CSS grid made with compass. It has customizable options for quick setup and bootstrapping.

**Customizable options**

- Main content width(Set this as your container width)
- Column Count(How many column do you want in total)
- Gutter Width(Specify the width between each column)

By using compass Titan will automatically re-calculate the grid when you change these values and output the updated css file.

An example page has been included to show column and row usage.
